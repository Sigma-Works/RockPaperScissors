<h1>Project Overview: </h1>
This project is about playing a game of rock paper scissors against the computer. You, as the player, can select to play either rock, paper, or scissor, against the
computer which randomly generates its own selection of the three. Every time you win, the player's score increments by one. Likewise, every time the computer wins,
the computer's score increments by one. Moreover, in the event of a draw, nobody's score will update.

This is what it may look like after playing a few (randomly generated) rounds with the computer:
